# automatic-background-color-changer
This project is a simple web application that changes the background color of the page every second when a "Start" button is clicked and stops the color change when a "Stop" button is clicked. The color is chosen randomly and applied at a 1-second interval.

Features
Start Button: Initiates the automatic color change at an interval of 1 second.
Stop Button: Stops the background color change.
Random Colors: The background color is chosen randomly from a hexadecimal color code.
Demo
When you click the "Start" button, the background color will change automatically every second to a random color. Clicking the "Stop" button will stop the changes.

Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: For basic styling (such as button sizes and transition effects).
JavaScript: For the logic of changing the background color and controlling the interval with start/stop actions.
Code Breakdown
HTML: Contains two buttons (Start and Stop) and a heading.
CSS: Used for minimal styling such as background color and button sizes.
JavaScript: Handles the following:
Generates random colors in hexadecimal format.
Uses setInterval to change the background color every second after the start button is clicked.
Stops the interval using clearInterval when the stop button is clicked.


How It Works

The random color is generated by selecting a combination of 6 random characters (0-9, A-F) to form a hexadecimal color.
When the "Start" button is clicked, a setInterval function begins, changing the background color of the page every 1000 milliseconds.
The "Stop" button uses clearInterval to stop the color-changing process.

Future Improvements
Add an option to adjust the time interval between color changes.
Allow users to customize the color range.
Add smooth color transitions for a more visually appealing effect.
